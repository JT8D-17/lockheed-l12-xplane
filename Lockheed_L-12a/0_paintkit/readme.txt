These are the GIMP files used for painting the Lockheed Model 12A. In some cases the Normal files are easily derived from the master files and in other cases I included the files used for the default plane.

In almost all cases, the master files contain a top layer called "Parts layout" which show the 3D program's object assignments on the texture that should give re-painters some idea of what parts go where on the texture file. In a few cases like the wings, there are labels identifying what parts go where.
